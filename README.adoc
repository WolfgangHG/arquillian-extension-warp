== What is Arquillian Warp?

Arquillian Warp fills the void between client-side and server-side testing.
Warp extension allows you to write client-side test which asserts server-side logic.

Using Warp, you can initiate an HTTP request using a client-side testing tool such as WebDriver and,
in the same request cycle, execute in-container server-side tests.
This powerful combination lets you cover integration across client and server.

Warp effectively removes a need for mocking and opens new possibilities for debugging.

Warp has built-in support for the following frameworks:

* Jakarta Servlet
* Jakarta Faces

NOTE: Warp version 2.0 (in development) is based on Jakarta EE 10 and requires JDK 11 or newer,
      while version 1.1 is based on Java EE 8.

// FIXME are these relevant?
// and it also has several framework extensions:
